# Branch plan — feature/account-domain-model

Foundation-first refactor separating login identity, authorization, and clinical
patient identity. **Docs + scaffolding only in the first commit.** No migrations
applied, no RLS rewritten, no runtime code changed, no data deleted.

Durable source: this file. Parked origin: `DEFERRED.md` →
"Patient entity vs account: feature/account-domain-model".

---

## Goal

Prepare the foundation to stop conflating the login account with the clinical
patient, without breaking existing patient/caregiver flows.

## Entity ownership map (target)

| Concept | Table(s) | Represents | Owner / actor rule |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------------|
| Login identity | `auth.users`, `profiles` | Who is authenticated | Owns own profile row |
| Authorization | `roles`, `user_roles` | What an account may do | Admin-managed; read-only to clients |
| Clinical patient | `patients` (new) | The person receiving care | Managed by staff; `created_by_staff_id` |
| Admission / stay | `admissions` (new) | One hospital stay | Belongs to a `patient`; `created_by_staff_id` |
| Account↔patient link | `patient_account_links` (new) | Connects a login to a patient | One `user_id` ↔ patient |
| Secure link codes | `patient_link_codes` (new) | Short-TTL redemption codes | Hashed (pgcrypto); staff-issued |
| Patient-owned care data | `patient_context`, `patient_checkins`, `patient_questions`, `patient_participation_evaluations` | Care records | Owned by patient/admission; staff only via audit fields |

Key rule: **care data belongs to a patient/admission, never to the acting staff
login.** Staff appear only as `created_by_staff_id` / `updated_by_staff_id`.

## Tables still on the old profile-based model

These currently use `patient_id uuid → profiles(id)` with RLS `patient_id = auth.uid()`:

| Table | Migration | Ownership today | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `patient_context` | `00008` | `patient_id → profiles`, `updated_by → profiles` | `patient_id` caregiver-supplied from URL — real mis-attribution risk |
| `patient_checkins` | `00003` | `patient_id → profiles` | Protected by `patient_id = auth.uid()` + patient route guard |
| `patient_questions` | `00003` | `patient_id → profiles` | Same |
| `patient_participation_evaluations` | `00006` | `patient_id → profiles` | Same |

Dependency to bridge later: `list_care_patients()` (`00014`) resolves patients
via `profiles` + `user_roles` role membership.

## Migration sequence — Phase 1 (APPLIED 2026-07-03)

The SQL files below were reviewed, applied to the remote OpnameBuddy project
(`rszlvszlkivbguxuvvvm`), and `types/database.ts` was regenerated from the live
schema. Backfill created 1 patient + 1 active admission + 1 link for the single
existing patient-role account. Security advisors after apply showed only
expected/by-design notices (see below).

| Seq | File | Status | Purpose |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `supabase/migrations/00015_patient_entity.sql` | Applied | `patients` + `admissions` (+ `set_updated_at` triggers, one-active-admission index) |
| 2 | `supabase/migrations/00016_patient_account_linking.sql` | Applied | `patient_account_links`, `patient_link_codes` (hashed), helpers `current_patient_ids()`, `redeem_patient_link_code()` |
| 3 | `supabase/migrations/00017_patient_entity_grants_rls.sql` | Applied | Grants (like `00002`/`00009`) + RLS; `code_hash` never granted/selectable |
| 4 | `supabase/migrations/00018_patient_entity_backfill.sql` | Applied | Idempotent: one `patients` + active `admissions` + `patient_account_links` per existing patient-role profile |

### Expected post-apply security advisories (not defects)

- `patient_link_codes`: RLS enabled with no policy (INFO) — intentional deny-all protecting `code_hash`.
- `current_patient_ids()` / `redeem_patient_link_code()` executable by `authenticated` (WARN) — intentional; same pattern as existing `has_role()` / `list_care_patients()`.

### Design notes for reviewers

- **Staff as actors, not owners:** `patients`/`admissions` carry `created_by_staff_id` (audit only). Care-data ownership is untouched in Phase 1.
- **Link codes:** stored as bcrypt hashes via pgcrypto `crypt()`; raw codes never persisted. `patient_link_codes` has no `authenticated` grant and no `authenticated` RLS policy, so `code_hash` is unreachable from clients. Codes are generated server-side (service role) and redeemed via the SECURITY DEFINER `redeem_patient_link_code()`.
- **`current_patient_ids()`** exists now for Phase 2 care-table RLS but is already used to let a linked patient read their own `patients`/`admissions` rows.
- **Backfill safety:** keyed on absence of a `patient_account_links` row (unique `user_id`), so re-runs are no-ops. No care data is moved or deleted.

## Out of scope for this first commit

- Applying ANY migration or running backfill
- Any RLS change or new policy
- Runtime code: services, hooks, UI, `types/database.ts`
- Adding `admission_id` to care tables (Phase 2)
- Renaming `patient_context.updated_by` → `updated_by_staff_id` (Phase 2)
- Deleting/cleaning orphaned `patient_context` rows (staff/self accounts)

## Phase 2 plan — move care data onto patient/admission ownership

Phase 1 introduced the clinical entities but left the four care tables on the
old `patient_id = auth.uid()` model. Phase 2 re-homes care data onto the
**admission** (and therefore the clinical patient), removes the login-account
conflation from the caregiver read path, and hardens RLS.

### Guardrails (same discipline as Phase 1)

- Every migration is **additive first**; nothing is dropped until reads/writes have moved and been verified.
- Each migration is a high-impact remote write and is applied only with explicit approval, then `types/database.ts` is regenerated and `tsc --noEmit` must pass.
- No care data is deleted. Old columns/policies are removed only in the final cutover step, after the app runs on the new model.
- Keep patient/caregiver flows working at every commit (dual-run old + new).

### Target end state

- Care rows (`patient_checkins`, `patient_questions`, `patient_participation_evaluations`, `patient_context`, and future `daily_advice`) are owned by an **`admission`** (which resolves to a clinical `patients` row).
- Patients access their own care data via `admission_id in (select public.current_admission_ids())`, not `patient_id = auth.uid()`.
- Staff appear only in audit fields (`created_by_staff_id`, `updated_by_staff_id`).
- The caregiver list/detail flow is keyed by clinical `patients.id` (not `profiles.id`); care data is queried by the patient's active admission.
- `requireRole("patient")`-only protection is no longer the sole safeguard for care data.

### New DB helper (planned)

`current_admission_ids()` — SECURITY DEFINER, mirrors `current_patient_ids()`:

```sql
-- returns admission ids belonging to the patients linked to auth.uid()
select a.id
from public.admissions a
where a.patient_id in (select public.current_patient_ids());
```

Grant execute to `authenticated`; used by the new patient-side care-table RLS.

### Commit checkpoints

Phase 2 is delivered as five local commit checkpoints. Migrations continue at
`00019`; order matters; do not reorder. Remote applies happen only with explicit
approval.

**Checkpoint 1 — schema additions and backfill — APPLIED 2026-07-03**

| File | Type | Status | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| `00019_care_admission_columns.sql` | Additive DDL | Applied | Nullable `admission_id uuid → admissions(id) on delete cascade` on all four care tables + admission-keyed indexes. Table grants already cover new columns. |
| `00020_care_admission_backfill.sql` | Data (idempotent) | Applied | Set `admission_id` from `care.patient_id` (= `profiles.id`) → `patient_account_links.user_id` → `patient_id` → that patient's `active` admission. Only where `admission_id is null`. |

Verified: `patient_checkins` 2/2, `patient_questions` 3/3 backfilled; `patient_context` 1/3 (the 2 nulls are the known staff/self orphan rows `0bde471c`, `0c90b156` — cleanup deferred); `patient_participation_evaluations` 0 rows. Advisors: only the expected Phase 1 notices. `tsc --noEmit` passes.

**Checkpoint 2 — helper functions and RLS preparation (Planned)**

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `00021_current_admission_ids.sql` | DDL (function) | Add SECURITY DEFINER `current_admission_ids()` (mirrors `current_patient_ids()`); grant execute to `authenticated`. |
| `00022_care_admission_rls.sql` | Additive RLS | Add patient policies scoped by `admission_id in (select public.current_admission_ids())` **alongside** the existing `patient_id = auth.uid()` policies (both active during transition). Caregiver policies unchanged. |

**Checkpoint 3 — service and route updates (Planned)** — dual-write `admission_id` in patient services; bridge caregiver read path (`list_care_patients()` → clinical `patients` + active admission; `/care/patients/[patientId]` keyed by `patients.id`). Reads still function under old + new RLS.

**Checkpoint 4 — RLS cutover and verification (Planned)** — `00023_care_retire_old_policies.sql`: switch reads/writes fully to `admission_id`; **drop the `patient_id = auth.uid()` care policies**. Keep old `patient_id` columns (provenance) and leave `admission_id` **nullable** (NOT NULL deferred until orphan cleanup). Verify isolation with a second seeded patient.

**Checkpoint 5 — documentation cleanup (Planned)** — reconcile `docs/*`, `DEFERRED.md`, and this plan to the shipped state.

**Deferred beyond Phase 2 (do not do now):** drop old care `patient_id` columns; `admission_id` NOT NULL flip; clean orphaned `patient_context` rows (`0c90b156`, `0bde471c`); rename `patient_context.updated_by` → `updated_by_staff_id`.

### Audit-field decision (updated_by)

`patient_context.updated_by` is **kept as-is** in Phase 2. It currently acts as the
staff audit field (the acting caregiver, `references profiles(id)`). It should
later be renamed to / replaced by `updated_by_staff_id` during a dedicated
care-table audit refactor — done as add-new + backfill + switch + drop, never an
in-place rename. No rename or backfill of this column happens in Phase 2.

### Runtime code touch list

- `lib/services/patient-checkins.ts`, `patient-questions.ts`, `patient-participation-evaluations.ts`: add `admission_id` + audit fields on writes; reads move from implicit `auth.uid()` scoping to admission scoping (RLS handles it).
- `lib/services/patient-context.ts`: key context on `admission_id`; `getPatientContext(patientId)` becomes admission-based; keep writing `updated_by` (staff audit field, unchanged this phase); update `list_care_patients()` consumer to the new patient-entity shape.
- `hooks/use-care-patients.ts`, `components/dashboard/care-patient-shell.tsx`, `components/dashboard/care-patient-detail-view.tsx`: consume clinical `patients` + active admission.
- `app/care/patients/[patientId]/…`: `patientId` now = clinical `patients.id`.
- Patient dashboard: resolve the caller's active admission (via a small `getActiveAdmission()` helper using `current_admission_ids()`).

### Testing strategy

- Seed a **second** clinical patient + admission + linked account (current data has only one) to actually exercise cross-patient isolation.
- Verify: patient A cannot read/write patient B's care rows; caregiver can read both; staff never becomes an owner; `code_hash` still unreadable.
- Run `get_advisors` (security) after each DDL step; `tsc --noEmit` after each type regen.

### Risks / watch-outs

- **Caregiver route key change** (`profiles.id` → `patients.id`) is the riskiest step; ship 2.6 as its own commit and smoke-test `/care/patients/*`.
- **`updated_by` rename** is deferred beyond Phase 2; when done, use add-new + backfill + switch + drop, never an in-place rename.
- **NOT NULL flip** on `admission_id` is deferred beyond Phase 2 (blocked on orphan-row cleanup); `admission_id` stays nullable this phase.
- Migration version divergence: remote records timestamped versions; apply via MCP `apply_migration` (not `db push`), consistent with Phase 1.

### Out of scope for Phase 2 (future / Phase 3)

- Organizational caregiver access (department/team/admission-scoped) — caregiver RLS stays global `has_role('caregiver')` for now.
- Multi-admission history UI, discharge workflows, proxy/family access.
- Dropping the care `patient_id` columns entirely (kept temporarily for provenance).
